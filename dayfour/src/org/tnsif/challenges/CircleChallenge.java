/*  
 * Question: There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at some 
 * point in the circle and proceeds around a circle in a fix direction. In each step a certain number of people
 * are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming 
 * smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed), until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.
 * 
 *		Given the total number of person n and number k which indicates that k-1 person are skipped and the 
 *		k th person is killed in a circle.  
 *
 *		The task is to choose the person in initial circle that survives.
 *
 * take = 10
 * k = 2
